# Devoteam Terraform Modules Repository

Welcome to the Terraform Modules repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for storing and managing reusable Terraform Modules.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a single location for storing and sharing common Terraform Modules that can be easily reused across multiple projects within Devoteam organization. By centralizing these resources, you can promote code reuse, maintain consistency, and simplify the management of Terraform Modules across your projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `./`: Contains reusable Terraform Modules that can be referenced from other repositories.

## Usage

Terraform will recognize unprefixed github.com URLs and interpret them automatically as Git repository sources.
```
module "example" {
  source = "github.com/devoteam/terraform-modules/example"
}
```

The above address scheme will clone over HTTPS. To clone over SSH, use the following form:
```
module "example" {
  source = "git@github.com:devoteam/terraform-modules.git/example"
}

```
